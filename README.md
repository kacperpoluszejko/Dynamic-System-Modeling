### 🌀 Standard Map – Poincaré Section Animation

The GIF below shows the evolution of the Poincaré section of the **standard (Chirikov–Taylor) map** as the parameter \(K\) increases.  
Multiple trajectories with different initial momentum values are iterated to visualize how the phase–space structure transitions from regular motion to widespread chaos.

All mathematical details and derivations are included in the report located in the **lab_8** folder.
